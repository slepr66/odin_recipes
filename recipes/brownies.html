        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Sugar:</b> These easy brownies start with two cups of white sugar.</li>
            <li><b>Flour:</b> All-purpose flour creates structure in the batter.</li>
            <li><b>Butter:</b> Two sticks of melted butter give the brownies moisture and richness.</li>
            <li><b>Eggs:</b> Eggs lend even more moisture. Plus, they help bind the batter together.</li>

            <li><b>Vanilla:</b> Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the brownies.</li>
            <li><b>Baking Powder:</b> Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the brownies rise.</li>
            <li><b>Salt:</b> A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients.</li>
            <li><b>Walnuts:</b> Nuts are optional, of course, but they add a welcome crunch.</li>
